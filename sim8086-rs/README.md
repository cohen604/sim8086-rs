# 8086 Processor Simulator in Rust

The goal of this project is to follow up with computer enhance course by building an 8086 processor decoder.

## Listing 37
Here We want to create a decoder that takes the assembled data from `listing_0037_single_register_mov` and decode it back
to `listing_0037_single_register_move.asm` (assembly code)
